## Installing / Getting started

Use your CLI skills and go into projects destination, then use `yarn` or `npm install`.

```zsh
cd theguysdesign
yarn
```

## Developing

All Components are included in `./components`. It's chaotic and should be changed in PR.

### Built With
* React
* Next
* Standard
* emotion
* Design System Utils
* All-Contributors

### Prerequisites
I think none :)

### Deploying / Publishing
theGuys and [me](https://github.com/robertgrzonka) use [Angular Convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) in our projects.

You probably should get to know [SemVer](http://semver.org).

## Versioning

As described above: theGuys use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

## Style guide

Soon.
